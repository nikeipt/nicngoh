title: Exploring soft lock features

As we've been developing the mobile app we've been spending a lot of time looking at other mobile apps in other verticals and exploring their feature and mechanisms and how they provide product value to the user.

I still subscribe to Chamath's view that you should really be answering one of 3 questions when developing your product at the beginning:

1. How are you getting people through the front door
2. How are you getting them to an aha moment as quickly as possible
3. How are you doing this as often as possible

What these features do however is provide a kind of soft lock feature. They're a class of feature that rewards the user the more they invest into it but also increase the inherent stickiness of the product at the same time and make it more difficult for users to extract themselves out of the product or switch to an alternative product.


### Spotify and play list
Within Spotify I see songs as the atomic unit of value within the product. Playlists however I see as a function of that value because they provide organisation and allow people to iterate around that core product value by quickly grouping together similar songs or artists.

Speaking to a few friends about this I can see how deeply personal these playlist are. They're as individual or as broad (I have a playlist just dedicated to my morning) and what happens is that once you create a few playlists on Spotify it becomes a little bit more difficult to switch to an alternative.

Your playlist are as individual as you are and it's not particularly easy to export these out. Once a user has a few hundred  songs organised into playlist, it becomes a lot more difficult to switch platforms.

### Follower count in social media

Whether it's Twitter or Instagram, they both operate in the attention economy and in that world the follower count is king. It dictates your social status and establishes a pecking order. In that paradigm, who's more likely to leave the platform? The user who has 10 followers or the user who has 10,000?

If we take Twitter at it's face value then getting 10,000 followers requires a significant investment of time and effort on the users part. That follower count with the additional metadata like retweets and likes are ways to express value in the Twittersphere but also makes it far less likely that power users are going to switch out to another platform.
