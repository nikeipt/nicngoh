Say hello to Joshua Bell. Solo performer at age 14. World class concert virtuoso. Owner of $3 million violin.

You might not recognise him but you've probably heard of his antics. Designed as a social experiment by the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/pearls-before-breakfast-can-one-of-the-nations-great-musicians-cut-through-the-fog-of-a-dc-rush-hour-lets-find-out/2014/09/23/8a6d46da-4331-11e4-b47c-f5889e061e5f_story.html), they dressed him in jeans and a tee with a baseball cap and asked him to perform at L'Enfant, a arcade just outside of the metro.

The man who had previously played for a sold out crowd 2 days ago, who has played for heads of state and royalty was now performing in a metro arcade opposite in rush hour. You can see the video below:

This little experiment has been used as a teaching aid for topics as diverse as why Democrats are sub human to why the Rapture is coming. What I took away from it though is a little nugget that Gary Vaynerchuk has been preaching for a long time. That Content is King and that Context is God.

A little memo about the violin the man is playing: The Gibson ex Huberman Stradivarius. Handcrafted by Antonio Stradivari during the instrument makers golden era, the violin is one of a handful that have survived from the 1700 period. Stradivari was such a master of his craft that even to this day his acoustics can't be replicated as well by modern makers.

You've got one of the world's best violinist playing one of the world's best violins playing the most beautiful work ever written. Beginning with Bach's Chaconne, it's a piece that was described as a celebration of the breadth of human possibility. As far as content goes, you've got proverbial gold. The context however dictates how much attention we can give it. It's 7:51am outside a metro station. People are rushing to work and bringing phones to their mouths "Talk to me!".

The relentless bombarding of advertising and social media adverts have created a battlefield for the currency of choice: Attention.

This excerpt from Mark Leithauser explains it better than I ever could.

> MARK LEITHAUSER HAS HELD IN HIS HANDS MORE GREAT WORKS OF ART THAN ANY KING OR POPE OR MEDICI EVER DID. A senior curator at the National Gallery, he oversees the framing of the paintings. Leithauser thinks he has some idea of what happened at that Metro station.

> “Let’s say I took one of our more abstract masterpieces, say an Ellsworth Kelly, and removed it from its frame, marched it down the 52 steps that people walk up to get to the National Gallery, past the giant columns, and brought it into a restaurant. It’s a $5 million painting. And it’s one of those restaurants where there are pieces of original art for sale, by some industrious kids from the Corcoran School, and I hang that Kelly on the wall with a price tag of $150. No one is going to notice it. An art curator might look up and say: ‘Hey, that looks a little like an Ellsworth Kelly. Please pass the salt.’”
