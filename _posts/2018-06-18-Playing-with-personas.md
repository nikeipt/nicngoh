We've had personas for a while at Pet Circle but rarely do they come up in conversation or factor heavily within our grooming sessions. A lot of the decision making boils down to what we attribute as our North Star metric.

I think personas are a useful tool because it gives us a common language when it comes to discussing new projects but I also think it's hard to care about them, especially for distributed teams that didn't participate in their construction.


### Why aren't we using personas

I think the primary reason that they're not used very often is that we don't care about them. It's hard to care about a persona that has been crafted to represent a customer base that covers a lot of the 'What' but not a lot of the 'Why'.

My biggest gripe with this (aside from the stock photo) is that it's hard to extrapolate in a meaningful manner from this. How would Janelle feel about a rebrand. Or a new feature that relies on a recommendation engine?

### An alternative approach

In the course of trying to design the UI for one of our user journeys we hit roadblocks where we couldn't agree on the best course to take. We didn't want to bring in users for a relatively small piece of work but we also wanted to choose a direction for the UI.

Enter Maude Flanders. Instead of creating a brand new persona, I looked at the user persona we were trying to create and instead piggy backed off an existing character we already knew.

This is still a trial in progress with my team but the outcome was for us to have a common language when we're talking about people. The personas we had been using before represented an idea of the people we were trying to target but it was hard for us to figure out behaviour because these were people we'd created.

By using existing characters that shared the same characteristics we shortcutted our understanding of the personas. We all knew the Simpsons and these characters and this let us have a common language when we were discussing UI.

Questions like 'Does she know that 3 dots represent additional options' or 'Is the tabbed view on this screen obvious enough' became easier conversations to have.

### How to measure if it's successful?

This is still a trial in progress but the conversations have definitely generated a lot more discussion, especially around aha moments. I don't know if we'll keep this but it has been a fun little experiment around personas.
