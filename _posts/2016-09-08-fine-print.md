So this morning a young man took trolling to the next level. He posed as a Donald Trump super PAC and dangled an enchanting romantic dinner with Donald Trump up for raffle and asked for donations. He receieved over $1 million and has spent absolutely $0 on Trumps behalf. Nearly 20,000 have coughed up some amount and it's all totally legal. Why? Read the fine print.

It got me thinking about fine print. That blocky collection of eye glazing words that we eagerly skip over. We can't progress until we've *read* it, but no ones really reading it.

Cue this [clever little gem I found](https://about.canva.com/terms-of-use/). It's simply all the terms of use simplified into everyday language and placed next to the appropriate section. Little features like this don't just help the user, they contribute to the narrative that Canva is creating about themselves.
