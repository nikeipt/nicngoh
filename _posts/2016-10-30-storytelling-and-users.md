So center stage - Chamath Palihapitiya. This guy is, in my opinion, one of those rare guys that can look at complex situations with a lot of different moving parts and come up with elegant systemic frameworks to approach them. World class poker player and one of FB's growth dudes this guy now runs Social + Capital, funding companies that do good and make money at the same time.

There is a lot of value in this video for growth hackers and product managers or really anyone hoping to build a company, all delivered with a wonderful helping of cynicism but I'll outline the big takeaways for me.





## Cynicism

Don't lead with your gut. Don't believe in your own BS. The big takeaway from this was you have to eliminate ego and invalidate all the lore. Question everything and never ever go around telling people "My gut tells me".

When you go down the path of gut instincts you compound structural problems that don't allow the important stuff to float to the stuff. There is no framework available to allow for feedback loops to perform sanity checks on whether or not you are focusing on the IMPORTANT things.

"Gut feel is not useful because most people can't predict corretly"


## Core Product Value

So when he talks about core product value he's talking about the magic moment. The point in the user journey when the user says "I get it. I understand why this exists". Optimising the user experience to that one magical moment.

For FB it was seeing your friends on the same social site. For Uber it's the magic of seeing that car arrive from simply pushing a button.

When you define success as a function of this core product value then you can start abstracting away developing the proper context for teams to work around. It allows decisions to be based and focused on "are we delivering this value to our users".

The simplicity with which he delivers it makes it seem obvious but again I think this is part of the charm. Define what your magic moment is and then define success as a function of that magic moment.

If you want to know more there is a great video by [Alex Schulz which can watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_yHZ_vKjno) that goes into depth on why core product value is so important to both growth and retention.



#### P.S

I think the AHA moment is different. You have power users that love your product and they have different AHA moments as opposed to marginal users. I do believe they are predicated on the same emotional feeling however.

Let's use Tinder as an example. The first AHA moment for a first time user will be when he gets a match. BOOM. I get it. I've made a connection, superficial as it is, with someone else. This is a pivotal moment for a user and if you continually deliver on this over and over again then users will stay with you.

For power users that have used tinder and are still on it, they introduced this little feature where they display your favourite song on Spotify. I thought this was kind of genius because it allows a new dimension of connectedness beyond the superficial. It allows you to peer across the aether and say "Oh wow you love The Chainsmokers too". It builds on that feeling of connection and is still related to that AHA moment.

## Chamath

I think a really big takeaway from this talk was minimising the time it takes for users to get to that magic moment. You have to work backwards from why people are here in the first place and deliver that value as quickly as possible. Once you deliver this from the point of acquisition, and you deliver that same value repeatedly then you've won part of the battle.
