title: Case Study - OpenAgent   
tags: [Product Management, Marketing, UX]

Just did an application to [OpenAgent](www.openagent.com) and it was a great little mental exercise. I only have 2 years experience and they were asking for 3, so I thought I'd even the playing field a little by giving them a little slidedeck to show where my mind was coming from

The role was for a **product manager** with a focus on **growth** for the company so let's break it down from here:

## Who are OpenAgent?

  From their landing page you can see that they help everyday users **"Find quality real estate agents in your area".** They act as a real estate agent comparison tool but the information isn't publicly available. In order to get more information you have to enter your details and phone number and a OpenAgent staff member will call you and gather your requirements and recommend a shortlist of agents for you.

  They provide the service for free to the end user and act as lead generators for real estate agents and their revenue model is based off the commission the agents earn from a successful sale.

## What's the situation?

One little insight that came out of the competitor comparison is:

Visitors were spending less than 1 minute on the website and it's easy to see why:

Information Prompt page

 And no you, can't get rid of the pop up window. All that tantalising information is just out of reach. If you choose to not enter your details then this is where your journey ends. Short isn't it? What I feel is lacking is any sense of rapport. Any establishment of credentials of OpenAgent as an authority on comparing real estate agents or any content to look upon to establish some sense of trust.

 To be fair you can view a [snapshot of agents](http://www.openagent.com.au/find-agents/nsw/sydney) and there is a [blog](http://www.openagent.com.au/blog), but these are located down in the footer where I imagine a very small percentage will find it.  

## So how do we encourage growth?

Where growth = more users entering their details and opting in for phone calls. If the user opts for the phone call then the user journey is extended and there is the opportunity for OpenAgent to establish rapport and demonstrate their expertise.

* The total user journey involves pre-product experience i.e researching their area, thinking about what they want in a real estate agent and so on. With the submission of personal data
