title: Case Study - OpenAgent   
tags: [Product Management, Marketing, UX]

Just did an application to [OpenAgent](www.openagent.com) and it was a great little mental exercise. I only have 2 years experience and they were asking for 3, so I thought I'd even the playing field a little by giving them a little slidedeck to show where my mind was coming from

The role was for a **product manager** with a focus on **growth** for the company so let's break it down from here:

## OpenAgent

  First things first, who are OpenAgent and what do they do?

  From their landing page you can see that they help everyday users "Find quality real estate agents in your area". They act as a real estate agent comparison tool but the information is gated.






## Mock ups

## "Why?" + a little Gary Vee

## Miscellaneous


> Reviews from real estate agents and whether or not they matter
narrow views i.e tinder/yelp/restaurant menu
