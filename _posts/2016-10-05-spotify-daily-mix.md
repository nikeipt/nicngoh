Spotify just upped their game. Instead of having to wait till Monday for my weekly discovery there is now a daily mix available on iOS and Android.

What I really love in this is how they've separated the artists. Unlike [Recommended Songs] which pulls from the playlist, daily mix intelligently separates the artists into different genres and populates from there.

What I love about these mixes is that it doesn't just introduce new music. It spaces out discovery amongst songs already on my list so a new song will pop up only occasionally.

What this does is tempering discovery with songs that Spotify already knows you like so that instead of just new recommendations it seems like an infiite extensions of a playlist that already exists within your musical taste or zone.

Timing couldn't better for a feature like this to differentiate itself from upcoming services like Apple Music.
