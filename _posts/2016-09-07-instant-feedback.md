As humans we require feedback constantly to determine our next move, both on the web and with other people. When we crack a joke and no one laughs we know "Ok tuck that one far, far away and never use it again". Our senses are constantly taking in inputs and pinging off the environment and when we don't receive feedback it leaves us feeling confused and unsure of what to do next.

Feedback is so critical to interactive design. As a user I don't know how many times I've left a website because I simply didn't know what was going on next. Did the coupon add correctly, did you get my details, do I have to create a new account?

A great primer on all these things can be found [here](http://www.givegoodux.com/feedback-5-principles-interaction-design-supercharge-ui-5-5/) by Joe Natoli. Below is a good example and a great example





## Godaddy
While browsing for this domain I stopped by Godaddy and ran through their website. So it starts off a little odd since there's a [Continue to Cart] button when I haven't even added anything. Bit eager but lets continue. So when you click on **[Select]** it changes to **[Selected]** which is great!

But then that little twinge of confusion set in. Ok it's been selected but so what? Is it in the cart? Where's the cue to checkout? The cart at the top didn't change at all, did it even add properly? Even if all these things did happen correctly in the background it still leaves two burning questions that I need to address. What just happened and what do I do next.

## Huckberry
Huckberry is a curated goods store full of boy toys and nifty knick knacks galore. When I add an item to cart it immediately drops down and even while loading it presents a little animation to let me know "Hey, somethings happening". There's a orange button to let me [Checkout Now] and when I move off the cart there's a little 1 next to the shopping cart to let me know my new duffle bag is safely tucked away.

Let feedback be the grease that gets your user from action to result just that little bit faster and doesn't leave them confused and not wanting more.
