Let's take a step back. Any product, whatever it is, is designed to solve some sort of problem or provide some sort of product value. Some form of aha moment that delivers it's own magic to their user base. Maybe it's the joy of a crispy bacon burger being delivered straight to your door or the ability to replace all images of Donald Trump with cats.

What happens however when the product you helped build is used for something other then it's intended purpose. What happens when we can't see the long tail of consequence from the products that we build.

## Infinite scroll and social media addiction
[![Infinite scroll](/post images/2018-03-15-Ethics-in-product/infinite-scroll.gif)]

In the 1970's there was an experiment run on pidgeons that found variable rewards supercharged the desire centers of the brain. Vary the reward and the pidgeons went mad pecking at the button. Our wiring's not too different. Throw in a variable reward, a pinch of mystery and the dopamine receptors in our brains go off like lights at Christmas.

Now imagine you're tasked with bumping up some metrics. Investors have expectations, growth is accelerating and those dollars aren't going to make themselves. Attention is the currency of choice and so the infinite scroll is born. We see it in FB, Instagram and Twitter. Around every flick of the finger is something new, shiny and oh so bright. The quest was to consume as much as attention as possible and stay on the platform as long as possible. It succeeded.

(Watching people flick through FB is disconcerting at times. Watch them on the train and notice where there attention lingers and where it skips. Nobody reads long text and videos have seconds to grab user attention before being flicked away. Cute babies and puppies win every time)

So what's the long tail?

We view things through the contextual prism of what we're trying to achieve. There was a metric that needed to be moved so it was moved. Who could possibly predict that it could lead to addiction? The average person spends some 2 hours a day on Youtube, FB, Snapchat, Instagram, etc. The average teen? Almost 9 hours a day in some way, shape or
 form â€”>

I find it impossible to connect cause and effect. There was the intention to get people to stay on the platform longer. It did all that and then trapped people in these short term, dopamine driven, feedback loops that have ensnared an entire generation.  

It was unintentional. But now we're here.
