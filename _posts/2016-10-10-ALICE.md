title: A Life Improving Customer Experience
tags: [Product Management]

I finished an application to [ALICE](http://info.aliceapp.com/) and it was a good mental exercise to get my head into the users point of view. The role was for a PM role with a focus on becoming an expert on the **customer and user experience**. Doing these mini projects I feel is a great way to know the product a little bit better but simultaneously demonstrate your thinking and methodology.

## Who is ALICE?

ALICE stands for A Life Improving Customer Experience (kudos on the acronym) and is a startup SaaS for hotels providing a operations platform for both guests and staff. The product is both B2B and B2C. Guests can arrive at the hotel, download the app and then access the hotels services via the mobile app. Essentially its a concierge in your pocket allowing them to order meals and requests services. For staff members and concierge services it's essentially a ticketing system, distributing orders to relevant departments and allocating statuses to give managers an overview of what's going on.

## Research

Caveat: I was only able to access the guest app. The research and functionality is mostly done through research and assumptions. No prices are listed on the website so whether these individual systems are packaged separately or sold as standalone is unknown. The ALICE app is actually 3 separate systems that make up the ALICE suite:

**ALICE Staff:** Focuses on allocating tickets to the correct staff member and allows staff members to indicate when they are done with the tasks assigned to them. Also allows for internal communication. Pictured below.

**ALICE Guest:** Allows guests to make requests that they would normally have to call front desk or concierge for. Requests can be anything for an extra towel to booking a reservation for dinner. Only limitation is possibly check-in or check-out which requires the physical return of the key.

Pictured below are some screenshots of the mobile app on Android. I believe the design had some compromises in order to make it white label for Hotel's to publish their own logos and text.

If your geolocation is already at the hotel it will prompt the hotel name that you are staying in

Opening screen lacks onboarding. I feel that this is because not every hotel will have the same services. Going through 5 different hotels the layout was different as well so a uniform onboarding sequence would be moot

You can sign in to have everything debited to your account however I used a fake name and room and it still let me sign in. If I had continued with the dining room request I'm not sure if the ticket would have been generated


**ALICE Concierge:** Concierge CRM tool which allows concierge services to add custom vendors and also communicate custom itineraries to their guests. Pictured below:

Dashboard view which looks absolutely beautiful. Great functionality with a messaging system to communicate with guests and a calendar to manage workflow.

This was a dashboard I found that gives incredible value to hotels. Being able to quantify user request data to make more informed decisions on staffing choices and what services are being requested more of. Incredible value.

## User research

For this mini project I chose to create user personas and user journeys for two different users. One would be a typical guests of these hotels and another would be the concierge at one of the hotels.

Identifying their demographics, psychographics and preferences and as an extension the typical journey that they would progress through. You can see them below:

The research for this was scraped off TripAdvisor using the excellent [Advanced Web Scraper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-web-scraper/gpolcofcjjiooogejfbaamdgmgfehgff) extension to Chrome. Age brackets were taken out, and the review text was parsed to see the primary reason for their trip/complaints.

Some assumptions were made about influences and their experience goals however I feel like these personas are always a hypothesis in waiting. Was this accurate? If not where did we fall short and why? For a mental exercise it's great but hardly conclusive.

The other persona for this was that of a concierge and can be seen below:

![ALICE User Journey Gustave](/post images\2016-10-10-ALICE\User Journey - Gustave.png)


Yes. To the sharp eyed among you, that is Monsieur Gustave from the Grand Budapest Hotel. This wasn't just a cheeky use of a well known character. If you have a persona who's personality is steeped in a character that is well known then it makes the persona more powerful. He is already known to the team and you can imagine his responses/thoughts without elaborate explanation.

I also stalked the LinkedIn profiles of 2 hotel GM's that were already partnered with ALICE. Looking at their work history and what articles they liked gives insight to the values and skills they value. A lot of them were hired and moved from the front of house all the way up to the GM position which indicates they have a firm grasp of existing technologies and hence why they might be apprehensive on a overhaul.

## Final thoughts

The next step in this would be to use these user stories to generate user pain points and see if any of these are addressed by current features/ upcoming features in the product backlog. While this approach works I also feel that it's somewhat reactive. There's a tradeoff on long term vision and reactionary pain points which has to be balanced.
