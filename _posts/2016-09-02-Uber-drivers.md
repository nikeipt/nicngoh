# Uber - Take me home

Uber is one of those products that garners one of my favourite reactions - "Oh god why didn't someone think of this sooner". Getting home from late shenanigans has never been easier, but over the weekend I got to see some features from the driver side.


### Finding Trips Toward (Name needs work)
I believe it's called "Finding trips toward" and what it allows driver to do is set their home destination. Once set it will attempt to match you with rides that will take you closer towards your home destination. Typically this will take longer to find a matching ride but it's helpful if you want to wrap up your night as a driver.

As a user I love the simplicity of the Uber experience. As a product geek I love it when companies take the time to make these features that make life easier for the service providers that depend on them.

Well played Uber
