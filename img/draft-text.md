Hi Canva!

I can see from the job listings that you're mostly after developers at the moment. If you're ever in the market for a product manager then I hope you'll consider me for the role.

Your work is amazing and I'd love the opportunity to contribute in some way. I've attached my CV for your consideration and I hope to hear from you guys. 

Sincerely,



Hey Papercloud

As you can see from my CV, my previous role was that of a product manager at a smaller startup while also requiring me to be the social media manager, customer service representative, QA tester and occasional UX designer. I'm not only used to wearing many hats but sincerely enjoy the versatility that it brings.

In addition to being flexible I'm also a fanatic when it comes to understanding the user and their underlying 'why'. In my previous role I operated in a customer service role to understand the user before generating user personas for both the social media team and the Flowers product team. (the result? Growing a FB community to 36K in one year and successfully prioritizing features in our backlog). Exploring consumer behavior and the triggers behind them are central to how I operate.

I came across your digitial team while looking into the app CancerAid. Solutions like these that change the way people operate is exciting and I'd love to contribute to your next stage of growth. If you want to reach me then please give me a call at 0423 373 990 and thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,

Nick Ngoh
