# UBER SHORT ANSWER AND INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

WHEN WHY IS ASKED GIVE 3 REASONS

### In 3 to 5 sentences, convince a chauffeur driver to switch to become an Uber Driver.
#CONVINCING DRIVERS

Reasons for switching
Network support from Uber
* If you decide to move countries you will always have steady demand without having to advertise
* All banking, invoice and payment needs are taken care of
* Flexible hours and also you may choose whether or not to accept customers


### In a short paragraph, explain how to engage local community groups with Uber.
#COMMUNITY OUTREACH

Local community groups will focus on whether or not the introduction of Uber is beneficial for the community or not. I would engage them on the issues of allowing people work their own hours while pursuing education/training. I would also outline the beneficial effects of having drivers to fight against drunk drivers on the road and safety for people getting home in locations where public transport is not up to scratch. Localised marketing would be beneficial as well such as promotion of their events on our social media calendar or offering Uber promotional coupons during their events.

### How should you respond to the city officials claiming that Uber disadvantages older drivers unfamiliar with technology?
#COMMUNITY OUTREACH

Part of our success is how accessible we make the process. Training is provided with forums dedicated to our drivers to give them all the support they need to acheive success. Flexible to accomodate older drivers who might only be available at certain times. I would argue that the technlogy is easy in comparison to old taxis. No need to understand EFTPOS technology or be at the risk of carrying cash.


### There is no traditional office or meeting place where all of the Uber drivers go before their shifts. How do you suggest to build community between the drivers?
#COMMUNITY OUTREACH

Ask for evangelists in the Uber driver community. The one's who have consistently been rated 4/5 stars and the ones who train others. They can organise events that either revolve around social points like a BBQ or for further training. Provide a platform i.e Facebook or forums on the Uber website for further networking.


### If the owner of multiple fleets is in an elevator ride with you, how do you convince him to sign up for Uber in 2 minutes or less?
#CONVINCING DRIVERS


### How can you convince a driver to upgrade to a 25% commission when he or she is making 20% right now?

I would convince him with incentives
If you clear X amount of hours/trips we'll bring it back down to 20%. It incentives them to work harder and also allows Uber to pocket more. I believe churn will be higher before it becomes the expected normal. Lead generation from Uber will always be steady so you're almost guaranteed work no matter what.
#CONVINCING DRIVERS



### “Uber is opening up a city remotely (i.e. Milwaukee will be operated out of Chicago). How would you make the drivers in Milwaukee feel equal to the drivers in Chicago?”

Eleveate their fears of support
- Weekly team meetings/memos/video support to all drivers and give them the same support team from chicago
- If you have partner trainers from Chicago go and train them in Milwaukee that will a sign that they are valued as the training is exactly the same.
- Social media and marketing will have to run parallel. Show that the Uber network outside of drivers cares about the area as well



### “Uber drops you in a new market (i.e. Oklahoma City) and says you have two weeks until we open here – go! What do you do?”

Assess the competition and immediately start building up a supply of drivers with a mixture of incentives and hype. Ensure that there is both a demand component and a supply to service it.

- Free $50 rides to create demand that will work for a month after opening date
- 100% commission for new drivers that sign up
- Signing bonuses from any driver that comes over from Lyft/Gett



### Say an Uber black car driver makes $US30/ride with a 20% commission. How do you convince him to upgrade to a new made up service UberSuper with a 25% commission? What costs will the driver incur in upgrading? How much more will he have to make each week? It’s not enough to just walk them through mentally how you’d do this, be prepared to do the maths on the fly.”

You have to convince him that it's in his best interest. Does he have to upgrade his car for this service? And if so what is the weekly lease cost? I would say that once he has paid off the lease cost then he'll be netting more in hand even with the higher commission because overall he'll be charging more per hour. For 30 an hr you're looking at 24 while 25% commission would be $22.5.


- Better clientelle to operate with
- $1400 a week - 1160 net after commissions. Minus another 200 for insurance and gas.


### “An Uber competitor opens in your city with unlimited cash capital, if you were them how would you steal Uber’s customers? If you were Uber how would you convince drivers not to leave?”

If I had unlimited capital I would fight on both the demand and supply sides. Steal supply and generate demand by undercuttying.

- Signing bonuses and 10% commission for all drivers
- Generate demand by having a 10 rides free deal
- Create a lot of marketing events to build the brand and outshine uber. Approaching catering services and delivering food/ice cream but basically getting attention and maintaining it as long as possible

### To convince Uber drivers I would focus on the network that Uber has worldwide and the support they can receive.

- Move to another country and we'll help you
- We have the flexibility not just in hours but also in getting a vehicle and using it or sub leasing it to someone else
- Prey on the psychology of fear of change.


### "Suppose you work at Uber. You have allotted Friday (every week) for interacting with the drivers and solving their problems. All is going on well at the start. However, on one Friday, 100s of drivers turn up together with each one having his own problem. How would you address each one of them individually? " -Operations and logistics manager candidate

Do I have a team? Do I have access to a computer? I would get them to write them all down and email them and then parse to an excel spreadsheet. I would then group them into similar problems and then address the underlying issues. There aren't hundreds of individual issues. There's perhaps 20, 30, 40 issues with various permutations of the same issue.


### "You get a complaint from a lady customer that the driver who drove her home the previous night, intentionally took the longer route to reach the destination, and she also felt the driver might have been drunk. How would you solve this problem? (All journey details available and you cannot involve the customer into this at any cost!)" - Operations and Logistics Manager candidate

Address the 2 issues seperately. Look at the time of the journey and the destination. Were there any roadblocks, construction or detours required that the driver needed to take. Give them the benefit of the doubt. Then I would look at the history of the driver. Were there similar complaints of inappropriate behaviour/ taking longer. Is there a pattern in previous reviews.

I would then interview the driver but I approach it with a circular attitude. Questioning directly will most likely bring up denial so I would give them the chance to explain their side of the story before making a determination. But the two have the possibility of being related so I would take this matter seriously since being drunk can lead the driver to ignoring the GPS.


### "Imagine you are launching Uber in a new city and have zero budget. How do you recruit drivers?" - Operations and logistics manager candidate

I would play on the Uber brand and setup a series of MVP's to cater to both supply and demand. Do a lot of content marketing that is free that all lead to a website to gauge the number of drivers willing to sign up. Step 2 would be to create a sense of urgency for them to sign up immediately. I would offer 5% commission for the next year in order to get them to sign up immediately before launch date and then create demand by offering free rides so that they will be serviced.


### "If there are three regular chairs and one broken chair and five people are entering a room, two of whom enter the room together, what is the probability that person X gets a regular chair?" - Director, Driver Operations candidate

60% you have 3 regular chairs and 2 non regular chairs


### "How would you incentivize drivers to go online on a Saturday. Can you think of a way that doesn't cost Uber any money?" -Operations and Logistics Manager interview

- Lower commissions since Uber would earn more from more drivers anyhow
- Release data that supports this i.e there are less drivers on the road and therefore more demand per driver or statistics showing average hourly earnings seperated by day
- Provide a non monetary bonus contingent on them doing a certain amount of weekend days with one of Uber partners. Free spotify account

### "If the Uber app was down, how would you placate the drivers?" - Operations Coordinator candidate

Sympathise with them immediately and let them know that our team is working on it as hard as possible. Ask everyone to go through the troubleshooting steps and offer them non monetary compensation.
- Free Uber credits

If the Uber app was down I would try and immediately find a way to substitute them work.

### "In four sentences or less, how would you sell Uber to a driver you are trying to sign up?" - Operations and Logistics Manager candidate

Assess the individual and find out what his pain points are. The big key points I would focus on would be:

- Flexibility in hours and ease of instalment
- We have a filter for unruly passengers with our rating system so no dickheads
- The slew of innovative features we have to cater to their lifestyle

### "I am an Uber driver who claims that I did not receive my payment from Uber and thinks that Uber is cheating me. What would you say to me?" - Operations and Logistics Manager candidate

I want to apologise for the delay in you receiving payment and assure you that Uber supports you 100% and would never withold payment from you. Please send me your account details and I will look into this matter immediately.

### "What would you do if a competitor came into play that undercuts Uber's pay split with the drivers? Uber's is hypothetically 80/20, theirs is 90/10." - Operations and Logistics Manager candidate

I would talk to the drivers and let them know that our demand has never been higher and that a 10% difference on a smaller amount isn't worth their time. A ride that is $30 will have a difference of $3 and our demand and our features are better than that.


### "How will you prevent drivers from committing fraud for incentives?" - Operations Coordinator candidate

- Personal GPS on to compare movement to the car
- Log number of hours on and off
- Compare reviews and ratings and search for discrepancy


### Write a letter aimed at Uber drivers who have an acceptance rate of 70-79% to encourage them to accept more requests. Use CSV file 2

Congratulate them on their achievements so far
emphasise acceptance rates and who have hit above it
explain why its good

Dear valued Uber drivers

Demand for Uber services is through the roof! Our fleet is currently at 119 Uber drivers and demand is increasing all the time.

That said we would like to encourage all our drivers to accept as many requests as possible. This isn't just good for you but also for our customer.

Currently we have 85 drivers who are averaging above 80% acceptance rate and we'd like to congratulate you on achieving this milestone.



### Write a letter to restaurants asking if they would like to join the new UberEATS service starting in San Francisco

Dear Restaurant!

We at Uber are proud to introduce our new UberEATS feature. Quite simply it works when our users open their app and slide the option to UberEATS and they can see all the food that is available in their area for delivery. They then place their order, pay through the app and then an Uber driver picks it up and delivers it.

For restaurants it's a great way for you to grow your business! You can reach a wider audience for your awesome food without having to hire any new wait staff or wait for diners to turn over in your restaurant. No more messy transactions or hiring a delivery person, all transactions done through the app.

If you would to start using our service or find out more please reach me through this email

Sincerely,

Uber

### Guide me through your resume.

I graduated from UNSW with a degree in civil engineering and commerce with a major in marketing. I worked as an assisstant foreman for 6 months before getting incredibly bored and then switched to technology. I started off as an intern before taking over one of the products at HeavenAddress. My main responsibility was overseeing the product, managing the budget and any new features that were to be implemented.

By definition Product Managers are a jack of all trades. I need to be technically proficient and be able to crunch data. Understand UI/UX with knowledge of basic design principles like visual weight and hierarchy as well as creating User personas and identifying pain points. Fundamental business understanding of why the product exists and metrics like average cost of consumer acquisition, revenue flow and modelling financial costs.  

### Explain why you switched jobs?

I'm very career focused and ambitious. I had proven myself in this particular product and they wanted to keep me there overseeing it. And I understand this. Why take a risk with a relatively young employee when you've got other senior leadership who can take over new projects. At this stage of my career I need to be growing and be challenged, not rinse and repeat the same projects over and over again. I'm looking for a challenge to grow.



### What types of projects have you managed?

Internal facing software tools, B2B tools for clients to use and also user facing software. The project I was working on had a lot of different stakeholders involved. The project was basically providing geolocation for all our cemetery partners. So users could come onto our app and then find out where their deceased person lay and use geolocation to find them accurate to 3m.

Part of this project interacted with outsourced workers from Vietnam so we had to build internal tools for them and also for our clients because they would need to update this periodically for new records.


### Why Uber

Getting my north star sorted. Working with smart-inspiring people, continually learning and having a positive impact are the non-negotiable.

I've been pretty obsessed with the Uber revolution even before they hit our shores. I wanted to get in on the ground when they came but I had just graduated from Uni with no experience. For me the biggest reason is they solve an efficiency problem. Especially in the Sydney Metro area. We're looking at excess supply that can cater to everyone but it's just not being utilised properly because of poor urban planning. We lose something like 16 billion in traffic jams everywhere in Sydney alone.



### Salary expectations

80 - 100K is my benchmark but it's not the overiding consideration. Culture and the work that I'd be working on



### Cultural fit

I want to know more about the culture here.


### What are your strengths, what do you bring to Uber

I'm guessing a lot of the people who enter this role come from a variety of roles but a focus on analytics. Ex bankers and finance guys with some data guys brought in. My relative difference are my soft skills. I'm great when it comes to empathy and balancing the other side. It's part of my previous role. I always had to balance the company vision with the consumer view.



### Think of a new Uber service and discuss it in detail.  

Uber school. Everytime it's school holidays you notice it immediately on the road. OMG the roads are clear. I live down the road from a school and it takes me 15 minutes to go along a patch of road barely 1km long. You put a subscription service for parents from the same neighbourhood or school district to get drivers to work in those times and guarantee to get your kids to school on time. With a message/notification to let them know that their kids are home.

**Roadblocks**
The biggest challenge to this is probably apathy - demographics for Uber tend to be millenials and younger generations but this is gonna change in the next 5 years when Gen Y become the parents.

Legislation and parent groups against children being unsupervised.

**Advantage**
Predictable routes. These routes are going to be the same for drivers 5 days a week. It takes a lot of the guesswork out of how much they will earn per hour.

You're average parent is operating at 20% efficiency for a single student. You get one Uber driver to pick up 4 students guess what efficiency just jumped to 80%. You've successfully taken 3 cars off the road.




### How would you encourage drivers to get on the road during peak times/holidays?  

Find their motivations and values and align them with driving at peak times. These guys join because they want to make money BUT also a flexible timetable. If the lifestyle is important to them then compensate them in another area of importance whether it's perks like


I think that either the money has to be justified to compensate them for the lack of flexibility or you have to offer up something in return. Whether it's introductions to pilot programs like UBERdash or more training opportunities with senior drivers? I'm not sure if you have senior drivers induct younger drivers but something to incentivize them to come along.


### How would you measure demand for Uber ice cream?  

MVP would be to do a 404 page. Release the feature a few days early and see how many eyeballs you get. When users click on the actual service it can either show "No drivers nearby" or something like "Coming tomorrow! This is just a teaser".

It's a good estimate but it's also some small marketing ploy. People will FB and Tweet about teasers like this.

Amazon does this all the time with promotions where you click and it just goes nowhere. User's are generally forgiving as long as there's a coming soon.




### Are the drivers employed by Uber or are they in some other arrangement

Their in a contractual agreement so no benefits. This is being ruled in California right now I believe but Uber is appealing the decision?



### As a driver what is my main concern

Is Uber worth my time or if I drove for someone else like Lyft. Money, flexibility in my time, legal context of my position as an Uber driver.



### How would you sell a potential driver on driving for Uber

side cash
flexible schedule
no boss, incentives
fun stories




### What would you tell a driver that is concerned about safety


rating system is in place to disallow crazy people from riding, as a driver you will never pick up a stranger because you get their name and info before picking them up.





### What would you do as an Ops and Logistics Manager

I would look at predictive modelling of demand using historical data. Historical data paired future data like weather, events and real time traffic delays. The advantage is letting current drivers know where demand is but also in the future when self driving cars hit the road they can position themselves better.

I think that while you have competitors like Lyft and other driver on demand applications the biggest hurdle is apathy and other people with cars.




### How would you launch Uber in a new city?
I would play on the Uber brand and setup a series of MVP's to cater to both supply and demand. Do a lot of content marketing that is free that all lead to a website to gauge the number of drivers willing to sign up. Step 2 would be to create a sense of urgency for them to sign up immediately. I would offer 5% commission for the next year in order to get them to sign up immediately before launch date and then create demand by offering free rides so that they will be serviced.





### How would you bring in more UBER drivers

** New city? Unlimited budget?**

I would start converting taxi drivers with the initial benefits. With a new city it's not so much competition as it is apathy. I would hit Universities and TAFEs for students that need part time jobs to support themselves





### What would you offer to drivers of UBERx to deliver food

Drive on weekdays or during the daytime on weekends, when demand for uberX is typically slower.

Drivers are needed for lunch and dinner service during the week and for brunch on weekends. You choose when you want to drive!

Restaurants seem overwhelmingly positive about UberEats, but the service isn’t without its concerns. Uber asks for a lot of trust. Customer interaction is handled by the app and the driver, and some argue a restaurant’s brand can be watered down — if not lost.
