While reading Maria Popova's excellent [Brain Picking's article](https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/04/28/what-makes-a-hero-joseph-campbell-monomyth/) I'm presented with the question "What Makes a Hero?". The wonderful animation shown below by TED Ed  
presents the classic hero journey in 11 distinct stages that can be seen throughout characters as far apart as the Hobbit to Captain America.

The thing is the 'hero' is just one of the classic archetypes as described by Carl Jung (You probably know him best as the foundation to the modern Myer Briggs personality test).

It's why we seem to see so many of the same characters in all our stories. The hopeless romantic, the rugged hero and the tortured artist. These characters are Jungian archetypes and they're powerful because they're universal. These ancient personalities are our shared heritage and span across cultures and history.
We understand their stories, their hopes and fears before they're even told to us.  

When communicating to your user it pays to know where they fall on the spectrum. Are your users 'heroes' or 'outlaws'. Do they have a desire to explore the unknown like the 'explorer' or is their primal drive towards creation.

Knowing the narrative that drives your user is important however even more so is understanding the archetype that your product inhabits.

Below is a map detailing human desire and its relation to the 12 archetypes. Taken from Emily Hean's excellent [slidedeck](http://www.slideshare.net/EmilyBennett/archetype-overview-from-the-hero-and-the-outlaw) on the same topic:
